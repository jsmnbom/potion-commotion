# Potion Commotion: Heart Edition

## *Grow plants, brew potions, maybe even solve a mystery*

*"Today marks the first day I was supposed to start as an apprentice for the esteemed magical botanist Arden Silvera. I arrived yesterday and I have yet to see any signs of them. I've found a couple of torn out pages of what seems to be their journal. Maybe they will be happy that I found them. Until then, this garden looks a bit run down, maybe I should get to work."*

## About the game

*Potion Commotion* is a cute farming game where you grow plants to gather resources and using those resources to brew magical potions with unique abilities. On the way you will find torn out pages from your master Ardon Silvera that provide more details on the plants, the potion, the garden and what happened to them.

The game is quite straight forward. You click on seeds from your inventory and place them on a watered field. Fields can be watered with the Potion of Hydration, which can be made in the cauldron with 5 pieces of a Hydroangea flower. If you're ever confused, simply refer to the game's journal.

This is just the basics. The game has a 'How to play' section in the menu and the game will guide you along the way.
